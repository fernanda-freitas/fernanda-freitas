### Hello everybody <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" style="width: 24px; display: inline-block;" data-target="animated-image.originalImage"> I'm Fernanda and welcome to my GitHub!

Iâ€™m a Frontend developer with years of experience in Ux/Ui Design (drawing digital interfaces, wireframes, workflows and prototypes) ðŸš€ 

I completed a Full-stack bootcamp in <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon's</a> super imersive program and this is the core of what I've learned: JavaScript (ES6, AJAX, FETCH API, HTML, CSS (SCSS), Git & Github, Heroku, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQLite, PostgresSQL.

I'm currently learning and deepening my knowledge in React, so the most recent repos you will find here were built using this framework.
