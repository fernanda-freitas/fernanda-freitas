##### (She/her)

Iâ€™m a Frontend developer with years of experience in Ux/Ui Design (usability, wireframes, digital interfaces, prototypes) ðŸš€ 

I completed a Full-stack bootcamp in <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/" target="_blank">Le Wagon's</a> super imersive program and this is the core of what I've learned: Ruby, SQLite Postres sql, JavaScript (ES6, AJAX, HTML, CSS (SCSS), Git & Github, Heroku.

I'm currently learning and deepening my knowledge in React, so the most recent repos you will find here were built using this framework.
